            <p> &nbsp &nbsp Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (November 7, 1888 to November 21, 1970) is best known for his work in the field of light scattering. He discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes in wavelength, which is known as Raman effect.</p>

             <h3> Some interesting facts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>He was the first Asian and the first non-white person to receive any Nobel Prize in the sciences.</li>
            <li>Despite his focus on the sciences, Raman is also known for his writings, for which he also received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1913.</li>
            <li>Raman helped discover the quantum photon spin in 1932, which helped confirm the quantum nature of light.</li>
            <li>He also made contributions to the fields of human vision, the optics of colloids, and electrical and magnetic anisotropy.</li>
        </ul>
